## **1. Business Problem**

### **1.1. Business Objective**
The objective is to develop a question-answering system that can interact with PDF and Word documents using OpenAI's API. The system will:
1. Provide detailed answers based on the content of these documents.
2. Help users quickly extract relevant information from large documents by asking specific questions.

### **1.2. Constraints**
- The system relies on the OpenAI API, which has a usage limit and associated costs.
- The quality of the answers depends on:
  - The context available in the documents.
  - The efficiency of the text chunking and embedding processes.
- Users must upload valid PDF or Word documents, and performance may vary based on document size and complexity.

## **2. Work on Each Feature of the Dataset**

### **2.1. Data Dictionary**
For this project, the dataset consists of text extracted from PDF and Word documents. While a traditional data dictionary is not applicable, here's an overview of the relevant data points:

| **Feature**            | **Description**                                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Text Chunks            | Text blocks extracted from documents to maintain context.             |
| Embeddings             | Vector representations of the text chunks used for similarity search. |
| User Queries           | Questions asked by users to retrieve relevant text from documents.    |
| Answer Output          | Generated detailed answers based on retrieved text chunks.            |

## **3. Data Pre-processing**

### **3.1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
- **Text Extraction**: Text is extracted from PDF and Word documents.
- **Feature Engineering**: Text chunks are created to:
  - Maintain the context.
  - Handle large documents efficiently by breaking them into smaller segments.

### **3.2. Outlier Treatment**
- No specific outlier treatment is required since the project deals with text data.
- Text chunks are managed to ensure consistency and relevance, with the goal of retaining contextual information.

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **4.1. Summary**
The project focuses on:
- Extracting text from documents.
- Chunking the text to maintain context and handle large documents.
- Embedding the text for use in question-answering.

### **4.2. Univariate Analysis**
Univariate analysis is not directly applicable to this text-based project, but examining the length of text chunks and their distribution could be part of the analysis.

### **4.3. Bivariate Analysis**
Bivariate analysis can involve assessing the relationship between text chunk size and the accuracy or relevance of answers generated.

## **5. Model Building**

The project involves building a system that:
1. **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF and Word documents.
2. **Text Chunking**: Breaks the text into manageable chunks.
3. **Embedding**: Converts text chunks into vector embeddings using OpenAI's model.
4. **FAISS Index**: Stores these embeddings in a FAISS index for efficient similarity searches.
5. **Question-Answering Chain**: Retrieves relevant text and generates detailed answers based on user queries.

The system is deployed with a **Streamlit interface**, allowing users to:
- Upload documents.
- Ask questions.
- Receive precise answers extracted from the documents.

The effectiveness of the system depends on the seamless integration of text processing, embedding, and retrieval components.
